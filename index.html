A computer is a programmable device that stores, retrieves, and processes data.The term "computer" was originally given to humans (human computers) who performed numerical calculations using mechanical calculators, such as the abacus and slide rule.
 The term was later given to mechanical devices as they began replacing human computers.Today's computers are electronic devices that accept data (input), process that data, produce output, and store (storage) the results (IPOS).
On the Insert tab, the galleries include items that are designed to coordinate with the overall look of your document. You can use these galleries to insert tables, headers, footers, lists, cover pages, and other document building blocks. When you create pictures, charts, or diagrams, they also coordinate with your current document look. You can easily change the formatting of selected text in the document text by choosing a look for the selected text from the Quick Styles gallery on the Home tab. You can also format text directly by using the other controls on the Home tab. Most controls offer a choice of using the look from the current theme or using a format that you specify directly. To change the overall look of your document, choose new Theme elements on the Page Layout tab. To change the looks available in the Quick Style gallery, use the Change Current Quick Style Set command. Both the Themes gallery and the Quick Styles gallery provide reset commands so that you can always restore the look of your document to the original contained in your current template.

<en><h2 style="text-align: center;">WHEN WAS THE FIRST COMPUTER INVENTED?</h2></en>
The first mechanical computer was developed in the early 19th century by Charles Babbage, an English engineer,
 and Ada Lovelace, a mathematician. At the computerâ€™s core was the Difference Engine, which was responsible
 for making calculations using multiple sets of numbers printing the outputs.
The first digital computer was the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC). 
The ABC was developed in 1942 by Iowa State University professor John Vincent Atanasoff and graduate student Cliff Berry.
 This computer used vacuum tubes to make binary computations and processed Boolean logic. However, the ABC lacked a CPU and was
 therefore, not programmable. Subsequent computer evolutions added programming capabilities, RAM, transistors, microprocessors,
 and portability as key characteristics.<br>
